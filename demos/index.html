	<h1>Foresight.js Demos using image-set() CSS</h1>

	<p>
		Its best to view the demos using a high resolution display because currently most 
		desktop and laptop displays do not have a device pixel ratio greater than one. Additionally,
		each demo has full debugging information included so you can see how the images have adjusted
		for each device.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="basic-comparison.html">Demo 1: Basic Image Comparison</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo displays images which have a browser width set at 320 pixels, but the image's requested
		dimensions adjusts according to the device pixel ratio. Compare the high-resolution images to the 
		standard-resolution (you can only see the difference on a hi-res display).
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="static-image-uri-template.html">Demo 2: Static Image URI Template Examples</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This example only uses static images and they cannot be dynamically resized by the server.
		Common examples includes hi-res image filenames ending with "@2x" or "-high-res".
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="dynamic-image-uri-template.html">Demo 3: Dynamic Image URI Template Examples</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo uses images which can be dynamically resized by requesting specific 
		dimensions directly within the image request. Common examples includes a directory 
		with dimension values, such as /images/640x480/awesomeness.jpg,
		or querystring values, such as /images/sweetness.png?w=640&amp;h=480.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="static-image-uri-replacement.html">Demo 4: Static Image URI Replacement Examples</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo replaces existing scale factors and values within static image request URIs.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="dynamic-image-uri-replacement.html">Demo 5: Dynamic Image URI Replacement Examples</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo replaces existing dimensions and scale factors within dynamic image request URIs.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="high-resolution-src-attribute.html">Demo 6: Assigning High-Resolution Src in Img Attribute</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Aside from all of the CSS options, this example assigns the hi-res version of the image file
		as an attribute directly in the img element.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="parent-element-percentage.html">Demo 7: Dynamically Resized Responsive Image</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo expands the image browser pixels to 100% of its parent element's width, and 
		scales the image adjusted to the device pixel ratio. This example uses dynamically resized images.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="parent-element-media-queries.html">Demo 8: Static Responsive Image using Media Queries (work in progress)</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo has primary content on the left side and an image on the right side. The image adjusts
		its size according to the available width of the side menu. This example uses static image files
		and requests different images using media queries.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="jquery-mobile-page-1.html">Demo 9: jQuery Mobile Pages</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		This demo shows how foresight.js can be integrated with jQuery mobile. You can use existing jQuery Mobile
		functionality to help adjust images when a device is rotated. Additionally, jQuery Mobile pages can use
		ajax calls to retrieve the next page which updates the DOM, not refresh the entire page. This demo shows
		how foresight.js is updated after page transitions.
	</p>


	<h3>
		<a href="resolve-method.html">foresight.resolve() Public Method</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Testing page shows how the public foresight.resolve() method can be used. Also useful for testing various scenarios.
